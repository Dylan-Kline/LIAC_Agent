☐ Look into if using a more intelligent model to evaluate reflections made by chatgpt 4o could improve performance.
☐ Implement a prompt asking the model to consider a scenario where they are holding the asset and where they are not holding the asset. 
    ☐  Update the structured YAML output format to have two diffrent keys "holding" and "not_holding", each with their separate reasoning and action.
☐ Create a basic website to showcase the model on bitcoin
    ☐ Implement a simple fastapi endpoint for the javascript to call
        ☐ Create an API key requirement so it can only be called using a .env file
☐ Create training and validation dataset
☐ Get training data and process it
☐ set up production dataset
☐ Create a script to run the agent on a specific asset such as BTCUSD
☐ Create a fastapi function that uses an API key to then call a function that grabs the latest action and reasoning the agents memory for the specific asset type
    ☐ Or perhaps have the function grab all of the latest reasoning and actions for each supported cryptocurrency and return as dict
☐ Add validation for LLM responses (making sure they follow the output formatting exactly, any deviations should result in trying to get a response again with the same informtion)
